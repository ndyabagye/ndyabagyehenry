The [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) is a tendency for human beings to return to a stable level of happiness or sadness despite major positive or negative events in their lives.

As I ponder upon this, I have just had what I would call a positive moment, though some would disagree, off to the guillotine with them.

How many times, I ask myself, shall I ride this high, before I start to fall into the warm embrace of the low. Almost everyone who is self-aware knows this. The random, fleeting thought that flashes by in a moment of happiness, that leads you to question when it'll end. It has even been memed, look up suspicious sponge bob.

There, I will save you the trouble.

Life is as interesting as it is complex, and only through so many battles and experiences does one discover, or so they say, the true meaning of life. The problem is that this is true only to them. Each individual has a different meaning of life and I'd say the lucky bastards often go through life on a smmoth path, with things aligning where and when they are needed.

I am tired of riding it, and I want to get off, but what is the alternative. What is the alternative to being happy and being sad and all that is in between?. If you have an answer to that, let me know. Who am I even writing this too, some other soul out there who somehow magically aligns with this message? Some intelligence who by chance and we all know nothing is by chance, happens to read this message and go beyond reading but identifying and resonating with it. Some one who is on the same frequency as I am right now.

An ugly thought creeps up into my mind, what if I am being narcissistic? Gasp !!. So self-centered that you do not even think about other people having a unique and different experience from you at this very moment in time. How dare you? I say bleep that and live YOUR life, not theirs. 

I envy those who do not think about such things, those who are unburdened by this. I say this knowing that I am not so remarkable in any way, _sike_, but knowing that there could be a thousand me's at this point all doing and feeling the same thing. Multiverse?? 

The little black rectangle glass gives so much information and in return it takes away your imagination and your creativity. It takes away your soul with its charming sounds and vibrations. The colors, the colors, oh my God !! they are so beautiful and enticing. Come, pick me up and scroll to your heart's desire.

The soul *WANTS* to do something, anything. It pushes you to do something, to create, to write, to sing, to dance. But then the material word, starting from the flesh, wants to do NOTHING. It wants to be steady, it wants to stay still, inert, lacking in motion. But only by the soul does it move to actually do anything. 

I **hate**, this word by the way has become a favorite of mine, I am having to sound smart, but then again I have no choice, I have to get these words out. When you triumph the body, the soul gets what it wants, the soul breathes a sigh of relief, takes in a deep breathe (not literally) and proceeds to push the body to do its bidding. It is almost magical the things that a being can dream about, whether in sleep or even while awake. Becoming one with GOD.

Now, you may wonder where I am getting these concepts from, rambling on about the soul and the urge to do things and dare I speak about GOD, but I have seen about enough tweets (or Xs LOL) and books, about this subject to decide to go out into the world and learn for myself.

What are dreams but the soul experiencing itself in other forms and longing to be a solid part of said dreams. Do other people think like this? I do not know.

The soul wants to have something to call its own. Most get a child, most get belongings, I will want these tomorrow, but now, I want to own something, I want to call something mine. Not superficially, but deeply and intimately mine. 

Ahhh, time to step off the treadmill eh, see you next time.

We want to connect to the ALL or something greater than us so much that we look for the ALL in people, in art, in music, in prayer, in work and so many other undertakings that we do. We want to return to the ALL. We want to be one with something. We want to be enough, we want to rest in peace.
