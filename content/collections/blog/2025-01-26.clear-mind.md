One of the most under appreciated things one can have, besides good health, is a clear mind. 

It is such a blessing to be able to think clearly, be at peace and even more so when you are aware of it. Of course, we as humans have long sought out other planes of existence, using various means to get there, drugs, yoga, exercise, etc. Thanks to our creativity it is a long long list.

The reward one gets from doing fulfilling work, solving a problem that has been bugging them and all while sober is a very well deserved one.

I say this coming from solving a bug on an ecommerce site I have been working on. It was such a simple fix that I am grateful I did not spend days and weeks trying to solve it. 

These ramblings maybe incoherent, but maybe to someone out there, they can pick the message that everything will eventually be alright. And it feels better with a sober mind.
