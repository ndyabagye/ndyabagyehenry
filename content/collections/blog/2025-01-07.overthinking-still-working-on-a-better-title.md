As the new year celebrations came to an end, and the thought of going back to work started looming over our heads (I'll come back to the looming bit in a bit, pun intented), there was a general angst especially among the young working class.

It was not helped with all the social media jokes portraying people crying about going back to work, relating the feeling to going back to boarding school.

But as (un)funny and as accurate about boarding school as they were, once one had actually done the thing, i.e go back and work, yeah the first day was a bit rough, but then things tended to kind of even out. 

Now it is a normal thing, work but the mental image that had been conjured up first by our selves, aided by the external influences was one of dire and utterly horrid working conditions. I guess a break away from routine will do that to you.

I am grateful for my work, but once in a while , more frequently these past few days, I have been getting the urge to stop fullfilling my dreams, and go out there and do something for myself. An update on this will have to be shared as this year goes on.

All in all, human beings are very predictable and very easily influenced, no matter how most will deny.

Did you experience this? How did you go about it?
