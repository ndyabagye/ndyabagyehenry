Recently I had the pleasure of falling in love with a song by MAGIC! called No Evil. I fell so hard that I wanted to experience it for the first time over and over again.

The thing is when I land on music that I like, I want to share it to people close to me in life. Though at that time I paused and reflected on those times something like this happened. Usually, most people are not in the same mental space as you are when listening to a piece of music. So the expectation that they'll feel the same way you do at that very moment is what often leads to disappointment.

Anyway, I played the song over and over in all my waking time, and I thought I would get tired of it, but no, the song is still as, if not more beautiful than when I heard it.

There is no moral to the story, I have just learned that rock, guitar and reggae music can be combined together to create something beautiful. I also started exploring instrumental music only and that is really useful for getting me in the mood to do something. Aren't we "vibrational" creatures? You tell me. That long soulful guitar riff can take you places you have never been, it's marvellous.
